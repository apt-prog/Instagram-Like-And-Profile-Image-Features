#Instagram-Like-And-Profile-Image-Features

🚀 Built an Instagram-Like Double-Tap ❤️ & Profile Photo Feature!
🔥 What I Built
I developed a smooth double-tap like effect & profile photo feature using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! Inspired by Instagram, this interactive feature enhances user engagement by allowing likes through a simple double-tap, along with profile photo integration.

🛠️ Key Features
✔️ Double-tap to like ❤️ – Just like Instagram!
✔️ Smooth scaling animation 🎬 – Adds a visual effect to likes.
✔️ Real-time like counter 🔢 – Tracks the number of likes instantly.
✔️ Profile photo integration 🖼️ – Users can display their profile pictures.
✔️ Fully responsive design 📱 – Works seamlessly on different screen sizes.

💡 Tech Stack
🟢 HTML – Structuring the interface.
🔵 CSS – Styling, animations, and transitions.
🟡 JavaScript – Event handling, DOM manipulation, and animations.

This was an exciting project, and I’m planning to expand it with more features like comment sections and reactions! 🚀 Would love to hear your thoughts and feedback!
